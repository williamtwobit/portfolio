william martian / personal portfolio.
=====================================

On the theme of the portfolio
-------------------------------------

I love a good scifi story, and my last name is only one letter away from the word 'martian' so I thought,
hey - why not do this thing alien themed? It's cute while also being cool, and it allowed me to bust out my
design chops in order to try to make something that was serious enough to be professional, while retaining
those cute and campy vibes that I love so much about scifi martians. I hope you like it as much as I do. ðŸ‘½

Tech used to build this portfolio
---------------------------------

* React (See below)
* Redux
* SASS
* Sketch3
* Zeplin


Why React?
-----------

I know, I know... using react/redux on a site this simple probably seems a bit silly. It's not an app, there
aren't many states to keep track of, and at this point there really isn't even a backend to speak of. The reason
I chose to go with react on this project is pretty straightforward though, I wanted the beautiful modularization
of components so that I can easily update / change / scrap pieces as I grow and this site grows with me.
I love react, but I'm not dogmatic about it. Frameworks are just that - frameworks to make my life easier,
and in this case, after debating with myself, I decided that the react framework made sense to me for this project.
